In this project, I use Huffman encoding to compress and decompress files. This project incorporates trees, maps, priority queues and file i/o to save bits. Huffman encoding was featured in the news as scientists used it to store images in DNA (https://gizmodo.com/scientists-stored-these-images-in-dna-then-flawlessly-r-1769813543) (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/publications/dnastorage-asplos16.pdf)
